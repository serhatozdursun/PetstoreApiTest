# Rest-Automation-Example
## This is the example project of Rest-Assured.

Here I have used Petstore Swagger API and created basic automation tests around the API response.

## RestAssured

Rest-Assured is an open-source Java Domain-specific language (DSL) that makes testing REST service simple. It simplifies things by eliminating the need to use boiler-plate code to test and validate complex responses. It also supports XML and JSON Request/Responses.
